<div align="center"> <h1>Wall-E's Source Code (UnOfficial)</h1> </div>

<div align="center"> Welcome and this is the unofficial source code for a super simple Discord bot called <b>Wall-E#8389</b>. These code only contain some of Wall-E's commands and this command aren't coded the same way but it'd work the same. I just made it more simpler and easy to understand.</div>
